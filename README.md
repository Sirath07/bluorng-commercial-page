# Bluorng — Premium Streetwear Frontend Experience

## Overview

This project is a high-fidelity front-end implementation of a premium streetwear brand website inspired by Bluorng. It emphasizes performance-conscious animations, smooth scrolling, and refined user interactions commonly found in modern fashion and luxury e-commerce platforms. The application is built using modular, scalable front-end techniques with a strong focus on user experience and visual storytelling.

## Key Capabilities

* Responsive, semantic navigation with dropdown store discovery
* Immersive hero section featuring autoplay video and contextual hover controls
* Smooth scrolling architecture using Locomotive Scroll
* Animation orchestration using GSAP and ScrollTrigger
* Scroll-synchronized UI behavior (navigation transitions, marquees)
* Custom cursor system with interaction-aware scaling
* Interactive product discovery with hover-based previews
* Direction-aware marquee animations driven by user scroll input
* Expandable brand narrative section with accessible state handling
* Footer system with infinite shipping marquee and structured navigation

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5** — Semantic markup and accessibility-conscious structure
* **CSS3** — Responsive layouts, typography systems, and transitions
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — Event-driven logic and DOM orchestration
* **GSAP** — High-performance animation engine
* **ScrollTrigger** — Precise scroll-based animation control
* **Locomotive Scroll** — Smooth scrolling and scroll context abstraction

## Architecture & Structure

```
├── index.html        # Application entry point
├── style.css         # Global styles and layout definitions
├── script.js         # Animation logic and interaction handling
├── assets/

│   ├── videos        # Hero and promotional videos
│   └── icons         # UI and branding icons
```

## Local Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Verify asset paths for images and videos
3. Open `index.html` in a modern Chromium-based browser
4. No build step or runtime dependencies required

## Engineering Focus

This project demonstrates:

* Practical integration of third-party animation and scrolling libraries
* Separation of concerns between structure, presentation, and behavior
* UI performance considerations in animation-heavy environments
* Real-world front-end patterns used in consumer-facing products

## Potential Enhancements

* Mobile-first refinements and breakpoint optimization
* Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, reduced-motion support)
* Animation performance profiling and optimization
* Backend integration for dynamic product and user data

---

*This project is intended for portfolio demonstration and front-end engineering evaluation.*
